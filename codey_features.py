    Example 1: Code Snippet
    x = 10
    def foo():
        global x
        x = 5
    foo()
    print(x)

    Correct answer: 5
    Explanation: Inside the foo function, the global keyword is used to modify the global variable x to be 5.
    So, print(x) outside the function prints the modified value, which is 5.
    ---------------------
    Example 2: Code Snippet
    def modify_list(input_list):
        input_list.append(4)
        input_list = [1, 2, 3]
    my_list = [0]
    modify_list(my_list)
    print(my_list)

    Correct answer: [0, 4]
    Explanation: Inside the modify_list function, an element 4 is appended to input_list.
    Then, input_list is reassigned to a new list [1, 2, 3], but this change doesn't affect the original list.
    So, print(my_list outputs [0, 4].)

        Your task is to act as a Python code Explainer.

            2. step-by-step explanation of code.
        Break down the code into as many steps as possible.

    Example 1: Code Snippet
    
    addition = lambda , y: x + y
    print("Sum:", addition(3, ))
    
    Explanation:
    1 Lambda Function Syntax Error: The lambda function is missing parameter names ('x' and 'y') and the colon ':' between the parameter list and the function body.
    2 Syntax Error in the 'print' Statement: The 'print' statement is missing the second argument ('y') for the lambda function call.
    
    Corrected Version:
    addition = lambda x, y: x + y
    print("Sum:", addition(3, 5))
    
    This corrected version of the code should now execute without syntax errors and correctly print the sum of 3 and 5, which is 8.
    
    ---------------------
    Example 2: Code Snippet
    addition = lambda x, y: x + y
    print("Sum:", addition(3, 5))
    
    Explanation:
    This code defines a lambda function 'addition' that takes two arguments 'x' and 'y' and returns their sum. It then prints the sum of 3 and 5 using this lambda function.
    The code is correct, and it should output the sum as expected.
    If you encounter any errors in this code, it might be due to syntax errors or logical mistakes. However, in this case, the code appears to be error-free.
    If you have any specific requirements or concerns about the code, please let me know, and I can provide further assistance or corrections.
